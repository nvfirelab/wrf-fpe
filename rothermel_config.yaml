# Rothermel ROS Evolution Configuration
# This file contains default parameters for the Rothermel rate-of-spread fire model
# All parameters are uniform across the grid unless overridden programmatically

# Fuel properties
fuel_load: 0.5          # Fuel load in kg/m²
fuel_depth: 0.3         # Fuel depth in meters
fuel_moisture: 0.15     # Fuel moisture content (fraction, 0.0 to 1.0)

# Wind properties
wind_speed: 5.0         # Wind speed in m/s
wind_direction: 0.0     # Wind direction in radians (0 = east, increases counterclockwise)

# Terrain properties
slope: 0.0              # Slope in radians (0 = flat)
slope_aspect: 0.0       # Slope aspect in radians (0 = east, increases counterclockwise)

# Rothermel model constants (advanced)
heat_content: 18600.0   # Heat content of fuel in kJ/kg
mineral_damping: 0.174  # Mineral damping coefficient
